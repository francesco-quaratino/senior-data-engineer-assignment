# Senior data engineer assignment

We are looking to migrate our Data Platform into the Cloud. 

So your task is to sketch out the architecture of our new Cloud Data Platform!

1. Please write down a Paper Dummy of that architecture.

2. Sketch out the tech stack that you would use for ingestion, transformation, data access, data
warehousing, BI-tool for analysts, orchestration, etc.

3. Sum up shortly each of the used components.

4. Zoom in on specific components and describe them in more detail.

**Overall goal of our data platform is to provide a self-service for our data analysts, so they can build
dashboards on their own.**


## Some remarks

You don't need to code in this case study, we only expect a paper dummy and maybe some pictures
outlining your thoughts. We want to know how familiar you are with a modern data stack.
The stack should be hosted in the cloud, and there are no other technical limitations.
To give you a time frame, you should not spend more than 2-4hrs

Currently we are ingesting data from various in house sources such as:

- REST APIs (e.g. our CRM Tool, other custom REST endpoints)
- Different relational databases
- Different event streaming technologies

*If information is missing to solve the task, feel free to make assumptions.*
